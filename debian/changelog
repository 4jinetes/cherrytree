cherrytree (0.99.43-1) focal; urgency=low

  * added action under top menu 'search' to clear all exclusions from the search; to be run from users finding unexpected exclusions from the search in tree nodes (auxiliary icons of ghosts, #1837)
  * added action under top menu 'view' to enable/disable placing the menubar in the titlebar (#1815)
  * unfullscreen doesn't work with the custom titlebar active (menubar in titlebar), so in this case we can only maximise/unmaximise when fullscreen/unfullscreen is requested
  * implemented under top menu 'view' toggle show/hide menubar with default keyboard shortcut F12 (#1849)
  * restored Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut to pop up unified search in multiple nodes dialog with only node name and tags selected (#1829)
  * export to html of code do not use '&nbsp;' - use <pre></pre> instead
  * fixed issue of code non syntax highlighted in exported pdf and html
  * fixed wrong line number reported in search all matches dialog
  * added new language Portuguese Portugal (work of Rui Santos)
